# hyperbeam
Environment for linking to the PMD: Rescue Team DX executable and implementing hooks.

## Setup
Install Python 3, [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) and run `pip install keystone-engine`.

## Examples
Examples for manipulating party members are included, see `source/main.cpp` and `patches/codehook.slpatch`

## Building
- Make sure that the `DEVKITPRO` environment variable is set to the path where devkitPro is installed.
- Run `make`.
- Copy the built `hyperbeam102.nso` to `/atmosphere/contents/01003D200BAA2000/exefs/subsdk1`
- Copy `starlight_patch_102/3AB632DEE82D59448599B2291F30994A.ips` to `/atmosphere/exefs_patches/starlight_patch_102/3AB632DEE82D59448599B2291F30994A.ips`
(if you're using Yuzu, copy the .ips to the `exefs` directory inside your mod directory, see their [game modding guide](https://yuzu-emu.org/help/feature/game-modding/)).

Alternatively, run `IP=[Switch IP] USER=[FTP User] PW=[FTP password] make listen` to build the 
NSO, send the built files to your Switch via FTP and connect the TCP logger.

The files in `custom_data` can be generated with [Sky Editor Deluxe](https://github.com/tech-ticks/SkyEditor.RomEditor.Rtdx).
